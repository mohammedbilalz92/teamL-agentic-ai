      "chunk_text": "Welcome to the Amstat client webinar series. My name is Sonia Burke, Customer Service Manager at Amstat. Each webinar focuses on showcasing a specific feature of the Amstat Premiere and Connect services. We explain how to utilize these features to maximize the value of the service and your time. You are encouraged to ask questions at the end of the webinar via the chat feature. In the last webinar, we explored the benefits of creating searches using the criteria search and advanced list builder. This webinar will build on that by demonstrating how to use the Saved Search widget within your dashboard.",

You can export aircraft and contact details for recently added or removed aircraft. Additionally, saved searches can be used as a sales tool and lead generator, helping you identify new prospects and track changes efficiently.",

If you do not see the Saved Search widget, you can add it by clicking the plus button to add a widget. The first option is Saved Searches. Adding this widget places it on your dashboard, which is customizable. You can move the widget around or have multiple widgets, including Saved Searches, on your dashboard. The widget allows you to save up to about 20 searches or reports generated within the service.",

The widget also displays plus and minus numbers indicating how many changes have occurred since you last ran the report. Clicking on these changes shows additional aircraft that have entered or left your territory. These additions represent new sales prospects to reach out to regarding your services or products, while the removals indicate aircraft no longer in your territory.",

You can also click 'Go to Results' to view the full standard report generated through criteria or keyword search. This report shows the entire dataset without highlighting changes, which is manageable for small reports but difficult for larger ones. Without the Saved Search widget, many users export reports and manually compare them to previous versions, which is less efficient.",
