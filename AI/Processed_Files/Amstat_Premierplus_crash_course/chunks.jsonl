Sonia shows her personal dashboard and explains that layouts may vary for users. She demonstrates accessing the Aircraft Valuation Tool by selecting a random aircraft, a Pilatus, and viewing its status and asking price. By clicking the dollar sign icon, the valuation tool opens, showing two sections: on the left, objective values considered in the base value calculation such as total time and engine times, year, make, and model; on the right, a real-time calculated table of estimated base values using a consistent algorithm. She notes a future webinar will provide an in-depth tutorial on this tool, including adjusting values and generating reports with estimated base values for multiple aircraft.", "metadata": {"timestamp_start": "00:02:26", "timestamp_end": "00:05:13", "topic": "Aircraft Valuation Tool Features and Usage"}}

Sonia explains that while all Premiere and Connect customers have access to FAA flight utilization data, Premiere Plus users receive additional Global Flight Utilization data provided by FlightAware. This includes recent utilization summaries, flight segments, and more detailed flight history. Using the Pilatus aircraft example, she navigates to the flight history tab, showing visual comparisons of the aircraft to its model group, summaries of flight activity, favorite pairings, popular airport pairings, and locations. She highlights that this richer global data is exclusive to Premiere Plus.", "metadata": {"timestamp_start": "00:07:21", "timestamp_end": "00:09:22", "topic": "Global Flight Utilization Data from FlightAware"}}

Clicking this tab reveals detailed metrics such as average length of ownership, average monthly utilization, flight duration, purchase type, financing, and OEM preferences. She notes the interface can be clunky with scrolling but shares a tip to drag the gray line to view all metrics fully.
