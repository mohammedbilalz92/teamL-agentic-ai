Most attendees are familiar with the basic criteria search in Amstat platforms, but this session focuses on the advanced list builder and its benefits. The advanced builder allows users to search by specific makes, models, and territories, combining multiple territories and models into a single report without needing to merge multiple Excel files. It consolidates results into one tab within the application and offers additional search features to customize reports.",

The session highlights that while the example uses aircraft, the advanced builder also applies to company transactions and changes. Upon opening the criteria search for aircraft, it defaults to the Quick List Builder, but switching to the Advanced Builder reveals additional features. Users can search by make, model, aircraft type, or registration number. The interface allows expanding makes to select multiple models across different makes and selecting specific aircraft types with detailed breakdowns.",
