00:00:33.879 everybody with Premiere plus references
00:00:36.559 in our previous webinars today's topic
00:00:39.680 is going to be Premiere plus given the
00:00:42.399 many additional features that Premiere
00:00:44.320 plus has to offer we're just going to do
00:00:46.440 a crash course on Premiere plus today um
00:00:50.280 all the other features will collectively
00:00:52.480 speak on today but all the other
00:00:54.160 features we'll dive deeper into um
00:00:57.399 during future webinars and really get in
00:01:00.000 there and analyze them and go over the
00:01:01.840 benefits of them um so today will just
00:01:04.438 be a overview on everything premere plus
00:01:07.680 has to offer and so you can see how that
00:01:10.240 differs from Premiere or

00:01:29.320 we can that
00:01:32.439 up so what is Premiere plus and what
00:01:36.320 does it have to offer so Premiere plus
00:01:39.479 varies it changes a little bit compared
00:01:41.439 to to Premiere or the connect service
00:01:43.759 with Premiere plus you get a couple of
00:01:46.119 added features we have the aircraft
00:01:48.280 valuation tool Global flight
00:01:51.920 utilization stat pack we have sanctioned
00:01:55.719 aircraft
00:01:56.920 status and then we have some metrics on
00:02:00.039 the operator length of ownership the
00:02:02.840 fleet
00:02:03.960 utilization um operator oems and the
00:02:07.799 purchase metrics for The
00:02:10.239 Operators with the amstat premiere
00:02:12.480 bundle it is one additional rate to your
00:02:15.519 current service agreement and that will
00:02:17.879 give all of your um licensed amstat
00:02:21.879 users access to all of these premere
00:02:24.160 plus
00:02:26.920 features jumping right into the platform
00:02:31.160 form start with the aircraft valuation
00:02:34.440 tool um as always this is my personal
00:02:37.440 dashboard yours might be set up
00:02:39.280 differently um you might see some things
00:02:41.480 on here that you might not find in your
00:02:43.599 service if that's the case just reach
00:02:45.640 out to Jessica and I and we can show you
00:02:47.920 how to maximize your dashboard or
00:02:50.400 explain anything that you might not be
00:02:53.760 seeing aircraft valuation tool we're
00:02:56.280 going to go into an aircraft view so for
00:02:59.120 this example
00:03:00.480 we'll just
00:03:03.120 pick random aircraft let's
00:03:08.640 do we'll go with this Pilatus
00:03:13.959 here now I pull up the aircraft view I
00:03:17.159 can see the status is for sale the
00:03:19.760 asking price is make offer and right
00:03:23.480 next to the asking price I have this
00:03:25.440 little icon here with the dollar sign if
00:03:27.760 I hover over it I can see it says click
00:03:29.959 to open the aircraft valuation tool
00:03:32.280 which I'm going to do and it gives you
00:03:35.000 the window into the aircraft valuation
00:03:38.760 tool so this screen is broken up into
00:03:42.200 two sections on the left we have the um
00:03:46.319 it contains the objective values which
00:03:49.200 we take into consideration with
00:03:51.040 determine when determining a base value
00:03:53.920 of Any Given aircraft so for example
00:03:56.760 some of those um values that we take
00:03:58.879 into consideration
00:04:00.400 are the total
00:04:03.040 time engine plans and
00:04:06.799 times and we also look into the year of
00:04:10.120 the aircraft as well as the make
00:04:14.840 model on the right hand side of the pop
00:04:17.959 out we show um a table that contains the
00:04:21.880 data that provides the base value of the
00:04:26.680 aircraft these values that you see down
00:04:29.280 here this is the estimated base value
00:04:31.840 they are calculated in real time using
00:04:34.560 the same algorithm for each
00:04:38.000 value so that was just a very brief
00:04:40.680 overview of the aircraft valuation tool
00:04:43.680 we will be having another webinar at a
00:04:46.120 future time that will specifically focus
00:04:48.680 on just the aircraft valuation tool
00:04:51.280 we'll go over how to adjust these values
00:04:54.600 um what these different topics mean or
00:04:57.120 these line items mean as well as how to
00:05:00.280 generate a um column within any Report
00:05:03.840 with the estimated base value for
00:05:05.639 multiple aircraft so definitely stay
00:05:07.880 tuned because we will go in more depth
00:05:10.000 about how to uh maximize the usage of
00:05:13.880 the aircraft valuation
00:05:18.560 tool right along we're going to jump
00:05:20.960 over to stat
00:05:23.479 pack so we discussed in our last webinar
00:05:26.440 utilizing these buckets one of them we
00:05:29.080 talked about was the stat pack bucket
00:05:31.720 here if we click on this it opens up the
00:05:35.479 stat pack home window from here you um
00:05:39.560 can choose different reports to generate
00:05:42.120 a visualization of any key Market um and
00:05:45.520 its data points you have um you have
00:05:49.000 roughly five five reports to
00:05:52.080 generate you can search by make model or
00:05:54.800 you can search by aircraft
00:05:57.639 type so if we click on any random
00:06:00.759 aircraft
00:06:02.600 model let's go with for sale
00:06:06.440 history and then we could go on
00:06:12.199 run and now this pulls up the report
00:06:15.240 that we were looking
00:06:16.639 for on the left hand side are some
00:06:19.319 columns where you can adjust your time
00:06:21.440 frame um the chart you can change what
00:06:24.639 data points you want to
00:06:27.639 see this graph here gives you a visual
00:06:31.599 um image of the data that you've
00:06:33.880 selected while on the right hand side
00:06:36.840 you get your um data table with all of
00:06:40.759 the numbers from active Fleet for sale
00:06:44.360 percentage days on market asking price
00:06:47.759 this data will vary based on which type
00:06:50.440 of report that you're
00:06:56.720 selecting and similar to the aircraft
00:06:59.599 valuation tool um our next webinar will
00:07:02.599 be specifically focused on stat pack how
00:07:05.720 to manipulate these charts and tables to
00:07:08.759 be very specific to your needs at the
00:07:10.879 time what you're running how to um
00:07:13.800 export print them and how to use them to
00:07:16.840 interact with your with your team or
00:07:19.160 with your
00:07:21.639 clients moving right along we're going
00:07:24.680 to discuss the global flight utilization
00:07:28.800 so right now now everyone does all our
00:07:31.199 customers have access to uh flight
00:07:33.720 utilization provided by the FAA this is
00:07:36.919 relevant to our Premiere and connect
00:07:39.400 customers um but with Premiere plus you
00:07:42.800 now receive Global flight utilization
00:07:45.520 provided by Flight Aware um there's a
00:07:49.199 wide range of information that you're
00:07:50.919 getting with the global flight
00:07:52.680 utilization you have the recent
00:07:55.479 utilization summary most recent trips
00:07:58.759 flight SE
00:07:59.919 segments and we can show you that right
00:08:03.919 now we're going to use our buckets
00:08:05.639 because we learned about those last week
00:08:07.319 so we're going to click on
00:08:09.120 aircraft we're going to stick with our
00:08:11.639 Pilatus that we just did the avt
00:08:14.720 on now if you scroll all the way bottom
00:08:18.159 all the way to the
00:08:23.319 bottom you have other details these tabs
00:08:27.560 here include information relevant
00:08:29.360 information on this specific tail number
00:08:32.519 and one of the tabs is flight
00:08:37.479 history so if we select the flight
00:08:40.479 history it's going to give us a wide
00:08:43.000 range of data provided by Flight
00:08:47.120 Aware here it gives you a visual of your
00:08:50.680 aircraft compared to the model and
00:08:54.880 make or a group and then here you'll see
00:08:58.680 some flight segments summary of flight
00:09:01.120 activity um favorite pairings most
00:09:04.279 popular airport pairings location
00:09:06.959 popular airport
00:09:10.480 locations and again this is a little bit
00:09:13.200 different from what you're seeing now
00:09:14.839 with um the flight uh the FAA data so if
00:09:17.800 you're interested in that Global flight
00:09:19.800 utilization you can only see that with
00:09:22.200 Premiere
00:09:25.320 plus now moving on to some of our most
00:09:29.240 most
00:09:30.240 recent um additions to the premier plus
00:09:33.240 service we we now offer potentially
00:09:36.000 sanctioned aircraft so you can see a
00:09:39.160 report a full report on that um along
00:09:42.000 with some more details on how we came to
00:09:44.519 that decision that an aircraft could be
00:09:46.720 potentially sanctioned also we included
00:09:49.800 Fleet metrics on um on
00:09:54.320 companies so if we go ahead and go to
00:09:58.760 our dashboard
00:10:04.079 here one of the widgets we have
00:10:06.480 available is this potentially sanctioned
00:10:10.160 aircraft if you don't have it on your
00:10:12.519 dashboard right now all you have to
00:10:15.880 do take it off all we have to do is go
00:10:19.040 over here to this
00:10:20.600 plus to add a
00:10:23.000 widget and we have here potentially
00:10:25.600 sanctioned
00:10:28.040 aircraft
00:10:29.640 and then it puts it on our dashboard if
00:10:31.360 your dashboard is completely full and
00:10:33.519 you want to see this widget closer to
00:10:36.000 the top you just have to click hold it
00:10:38.240 and you can drag it anywhere on your
00:10:40.639 dashboard that you like to see it and as
00:10:43.560 you can see here we have a full list of
00:10:46.120 aircraft that we have marked as
00:10:48.839 potentially sanctioned with the
00:10:52.399 sources so that's a good way to see the
00:10:55.440 full list of aircraft that are
00:10:57.240 potentially sanctioned in one report
00:10:59.760 if you wanted to go to the source you
00:11:02.880 can click on the make
00:11:07.120 model and in the same location where we
00:11:09.959 saw the um Global flight utilization
00:11:12.600 we're going to scroll down to the
00:11:19.000 bottom and we have this sanction
00:11:23.040 tab so this will give you um our source
00:11:27.240 when it was sanctioned
00:11:30.200 and then if you have any questions on
00:11:32.160 this particular aircraft um you can
00:11:35.000 always click on service at amstat
00:11:37.519 corp.com and reach out to
00:11:39.839 us another nice feature with this is
00:11:42.800 right at the top it'll give you that
00:11:45.000 this aircraft is potentially
00:11:51.240 sanctioned now moving on to the fleet
00:11:55.639 metrics so now if you go into a company
00:11:58.680 View for
00:12:00.560 example let's do
00:12:02.600 Sketchers I can type in my company to
00:12:05.040 the keyword search if I'm working off of
00:12:07.720 a company of I've already searched today
00:12:10.120 or at some point I can click on company
00:12:12.279 and click on one of the
00:12:14.199 tabs but we'll use the keyword for this
00:12:16.680 we'll click on
00:12:20.880 Sketchers here's the information that
00:12:23.560 we're used to seeing in Premiere or
00:12:25.880 connect um but then you see over here
00:12:28.600 next to address we have this Fleet
00:12:30.519 metrics tab if we click on this we get
00:12:34.079 some fleet metrics some of these metrics
00:12:37.000 that we talked about really quickly at
00:12:39.199 the beginning were um the the purchase
00:12:42.079 type um we have the financing the OEM
00:12:46.240 preference now it's a little cut off
00:12:48.800 here and it's little clunky scrolling up
00:12:50.920 and down uh a nice trick that I like to
00:12:53.800 do when I'm looking at the fleet metrics
00:12:56.279 if I take my cursor down to this little
00:12:59.120 Gray Line hold right click and hold down
00:13:02.079 I can drag this all the way down and
00:13:04.240 then I can see the metrics in its
00:13:09.399 entirety so here we have for Sketchers
00:13:12.320 it breaks down into the average length
00:13:14.320 of
00:13:15.079 ownership um average monthly
00:13:18.199 utilization flight
00:13:20.399 duration purchase type and then we have
00:13:23.839 some financing and OEM
00:13:27.760 preferences
00:13:29.880 again we'll dive a little bit deeper
00:13:31.360 into this into future webinars but this
00:13:34.040 is really nice if you're looking to see
00:13:36.720 um how long they usually hang on to an
00:13:38.720 aircraft so for them they usually hang
00:13:40.680 on to heavy jet Jets um currently this
00:13:43.959 one is 4.1 years while historically it's
00:13:47.160 been a little closer to two years that
00:13:49.279 they hang on to an
00:13:57.759 aircraft
00:14:00.959 then um that would be the entirety of
00:14:04.279 the amap premiere plus features um we do
00:14:09.000 offer demos of the Premier plus Service
00:14:12.240 as well as trials so if anyone on your
00:14:15.120 team is currently interested in demoing
00:14:18.399 the amstat premiere plus you can always
00:14:20.880 reach out to myself and we can set you
00:14:23.279 up with a um demo or
00:14:27.680 trial
00:14:30.040 next week or not next week next webinar
00:14:33.040 is going to be on February 5th and the
00:14:36.160 topic will be statpack so we'll go
00:14:38.920 through understanding the data provided
00:14:41.279 by statpack those five different reports
00:14:43.440 we'll go over them in in full detail and
00:14:46.959 how to um use them and leverage the data
00:14:50.120 within staack when you're creating
00:14:52.560 presentations for your your prospects or
00:14:55.160 clients or even just your team members
00:14:57.160 if you're presenting some new new
00:14:58.920 information or educating your team on
00:15:01.519 anything you can um we'll show you how
00:15:04.079 to to navigate those additional
